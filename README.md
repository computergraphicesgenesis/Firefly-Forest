# Dark-Forest
![alt text](http://darkforest.bongiovi.tw/darkForestCover.jpg)

Dark Forest is the culmination of a series of thoughts and experiments that began in 2014.

In this project I studied the flashing behaviour of the fireflies and discovered their interesting synchronicities. I tried to recreate this with code and also combine it with the flocking behaviour. This experience is built using c++ with Cinder framework.
